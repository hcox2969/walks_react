        <h1>Making a Gravel or Mulch Walk</h1>
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-sm">
            <p>Gravel and mulch are good choices for a casual or lightly traveled walk. Bricks, timbers, or other edging help keep the surface from spreading into the lawn. Flooding can be a problem, so pick a dry spot, and lay 1- to 2-inch layer of sand in the excavation for drainage. Cover it with landscape fabric to prevent sand from working into the gravel or mulch and to keep weeds out. Add a 4-inch layer of gravel or mulch and tamp for a firm surface.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-sm">
            <p>Combining materials, such as concrete, brick, or wood, with the mulch or gravel can create interesting options or patterns. </p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-sm">
            <p>At its simplest, a walk is nothing more than some gravel or mulch spread on the ground. The walk shown here is a bit more durable. Edging keeps the surface from spreading into your yard. Sand provides a sturdy base that can easily be smoothed flat. If you want a mulch walk, bark mulch is less prone to rot and fungus. If you are building a gravel walk, pea gravel and crushed stone make good walking surfaces. Check with your local building supplier. Some types of gravel and stone are available only in certain areas of the country. </p>

        <CardText>Plastic edging is inexpensive, flexible, and sticks up on 1/2-inch from the ground once installed. Dig a trench, place the edging in it, and align the aging with your layout line. Anchor the edging by driving plastic stakes through its bottom edge with a 3-pound sledgehammer. Fill the trench with soil, then compact it with a 2x4. </CardText>

        <CardText>Benderboard is made of thin layers of wood â€”  often redwood. Drive stakes along the inside edge of the curve and temporarily score the bender board to them. Add layers until the curve is as thick as the rest of the edging, then drive stakes to support the back. Screw them to the benderboard; remove inside stakes.
